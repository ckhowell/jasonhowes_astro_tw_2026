### Building a high-performance sales culture is similar to cooking a delicious meal. If you miss some vital steps, do too much of this, or not enough of that, the meal will fail, leaving a bad taste in your mouth. 

Know your ingredients. ... (right people, what success looks like to scale) 
Don't be afraid to experiment. (take calculated risks, new market segments, new products or expanding current range).

Equip your kitchen with the right equipment. (sales systems, process & tech)Taste. (to ensure it's on track, add salt or spice it up, baby 🌶️) Research recipes for what you are planning to cook. (Be an expert in your space; hang out where your tribe does).

Plan. (You're nicked if you don't; scattergun will only get you so far) Keep it as simple as possible. ... Be proactive, not reactive to general sales enquiries (Remove the noise, point, aim and fire) 🏹

Think of textures when you're cooking meals. Ensure your tone and powerful sales messaging are outcome-focused. This will make your prospect enjoy your time and want to know more, not avoid booking a 📅.

If you try to cook too quickly, rush or miss some vital ingredients, your sales training and team development will boil over, leaving a messy and expensive cleanup bill. (Nobody likes having to clean up!)
