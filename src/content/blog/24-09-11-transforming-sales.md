*Innovative Strategies and Cutting-Edge Technology Redefine Sales Performance. By Campbell McInnes*

In an increasingly competitive business landscape, the traditional methods of recruitment and sales training are proving insufficient. Enter Arrow Executive Sales, an Australian company that has distinguished itself by blending science and technology with strategic analysis and sales enablement to redefine what it means to cultivate a high-performing sales team.

Jason Howes, Owner and Managing Director of Arrow, is a veteran of the sales industry with over three decades of experience. His journey from a novice salesperson in 1989 to the helm of Arrow has been marked by a relentless pursuit of innovation and excellence. This drive is evident in Arrow’s unique approach to recruitment and training. Jason explained,

> “having walked in the shoes of the salesperson, and sales leader gives me a great understanding of what challenges they face. I actively sell every single day, so I know what it’s like.”

On average, companies invest between 2% and 5% of payroll on sales training. For example, if you pay your salespeople an annual base salary of $100,000, you should invest between $2,000 and $5,000 in yearly sales training per employee. Investing in sales training should be looked at as a ROI (return on investment), not a cost. Howes question to companies is “what if your $5,000 investment made you $20,000 or $50,000, let alone raised the bar within your company?” Arrow Executive Sales, which has been operational for five and a half years, stands out by using sophisticated tools and technologies that are globally recognized for their efficacy. “The old school methods will only take a salesperson so far,” Howes notes.

In an industry like timber and forest products, where selling new products presents unique challenges, Arrow’s approach offers a significant competitive edge.

**THE ARROW EXECUTIVE ADVANTAGE**

Partnership Approach Arrow Executive collaborates closely with clients, fostering a genuine team effort. This partnership mentality ensures that both parties are fully invested in achieving mutual success.

Decades of Expertise With more than thirty years of experience, Arrow Executive brings a wealth of knowledge and proven strategies to the table. This extensive background allows them to tackle a wide range of sales challenges effectively.

Tailored Solutions Recognizing that every business is unique, Arrow Executive customizes their programs to meet each customer’s specific needs. This personalized approach maximizes the impact of their training and recruitment services.

This holistic approach is designed to address the common pitfalls in sales teams.

Howes explained “many businesses still operate with a “hit and hope” mentality, a shotgun approach that lacks focus and strategic direction. Arrow, on the other hand, ensures that every salesperson is aligned with the company’s goals and equipped with the right tools and mindset.” to create and win more new business opportunities.

**A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO SALES EXCELLENCE**

Arrow’s methodology can be encapsulated in a four-step “EDGE” process: Evaluate, Develop, Grow, and Execute. This begins with a strategic analysis to evaluate the current state of a sales team, followed by the development of tailored sales strategies. It’s critical to uncover what you’re working with in systems, process and people.

Next, Arrow focuses on sales enablement, equipping teams with the tools and knowledge they need, and finally, provides ongoing training and coaching to ensure consistent execution.

**HARNESSING TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE FOR EXPERT SALES RECRUITMENT**

A key differentiator for Arrow is its integration of data and science into the recruitment and training processes. “I wanted more data and more science to be different than traditional recruitment,” Howes explains. By partnering with the Objective Management Group, (OMG) Arrow leverages tools that compare salespeople across a wide range of industries globally to predict candidate success with 95% accuracy before you hire someone, not find out later.

This comparative analysis helps pinpoint where a salesperson may be struggling and how best to support their onboarding and development. This is crucial in industries like timber, where the introduction of new products requires a nuanced and skilled approach to sales which many salespeople have never been trained for.

**Onboarding Program:** A comprehensive 4-week onboarding process that includes functional HR automation, saving valuable time and ensuring new employees are quickly up to speed.

Howes advised “by providing a total package, Arrow ensures that businesses can focus on growth, innovation and technology rather than the day-to-day struggles of managing a sales team. Most people are time poor, with automation and process we focus on getting your team working on the right activities, not just the comfortable ones.”
